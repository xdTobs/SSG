Statistical Setup Guard is a post-game analysis tool designed to help Valorant players optimize their defensive setups by analyzing patterns from previous matches. The tool collects and processes data through the /val/match/v1/matches/{matchId}, /val/match/v1/matchlists/by-puuid/{puuid}, and /val/match/v1/recent-matches/by-queue/{queue} endpoints to gather insights about team positioning, player tendencies, and overall defensive performance.

Statistical Setup Guard provides detailed feedback after each game, identifying recurring setups and patterns across various maps and ranks. This allows players to review their performance and refine their defensive strategies based on what has been most effective in past matches. The tool includes a user-friendly interface where players can access in-depth match breakdowns, heatmaps of player movements, and key recommendations for improving defensive tactics in future games.

Statistical Setup Guard empowers players with data-driven insights to enhance their defensive setups and overall decision-making, offering a valuable resource for improving performance after every match.
